# 2048-clone
Created by Michal Mitro.

This project is a clone of a popular number game 2048 implemented in JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It was created because I wanted to improve my skills in these languages.

Project is a simple SPA written without any JavaScript frameworks or other dependencies. This repository contains only a frontend version of this project, 
with plans to create a simple Node.js backend, that will allow user to create a simple account and get a record on the leaderboard. 
Storage for this backend will be created by using MongoDB.
